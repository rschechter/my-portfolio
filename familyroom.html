         <p class="ps-text-body">When families expand and mature it can sometimes be difficult for all members to stay in the 
           loop and maintain a close connection. I wanted to figure out a way to preserve and even strengthen these connections

         <h3 class="ps">Solution</h3>
         <p class="ps-text-body">I created Family Room which is a mix between a social media and group messaging application. 
           The app features a linear group chat, organized group media, and conference calling to give people multiple ways of 
           staying in touch and in each others’ lives while keeping things private and just within the family.</p>

         <p class="card-text">1. Too many chats and all on different platforms. Most of them only work either if you have a specific 
           type of phone (like iPhone for iMessages) or if everyone has the same app (like WhatsApp or Group Me.</p>

            <p class="fr-case-study-text">After the app’s branding and identity was finished and applied to prior designs, I created a series of high-fidelity 
              mockups which were based on the original low-fi wireframes.</p>

        <h4 class="purple-text">User Testing 2</h4>
        <p class="fr-case-study-text">I tested out my mockups in the form of a clickable prototype with a number of users. The users brought up some excellent questions about select features, 
          and these conversations helped shape many design decisions that I made to produce the final product. Below are summaries of these conversations and a look at how the final 
          product came to be. </p>
         
          <p class="purple-text-title">Topic 1: Conference Calling</p>
            <p class="fr-case-study-text">This was a feature I thought should be included in Family Room as it contributes to the goal of  having all modes of communication accessible through the app. 
              In the original model, by  pressing the “Phone Conference Call” or “Video Conference Call” buttons, everyone who is online receives a call unless there are only two people online, 
              in which case no call would be placed. The reasoning for this was to stand out and not compete with apps offering one-on-one calling.</p>
           
              <p id="some-q" class="fr-case-study-text">Some questions that my testers asked were:</p>
              <p class="regular-bold-title purple-text">1. What if there are 8 members online but I only want to talk to 4 of them? Can I specify  which members I wish to include?</p>
              <p class="fr-case-study-text">I liked the concept of selection/deselection, so I tried including this feature  by adding a short disclaimer. Here is what the interface looked like at that point:</p>
              <img id="deselect" src="images/call-deselect.png">       
              <p class="regular-bold-title purple-text">2. What if someone wants to receive a call initiated by a group member even if they’re not currently using the app? </p>
              <p class="fr-case-study-text">I thought this was a good point, and figured that in a fleshed out app, a user can modify their call settings so that they choose when they receive calls – 
                either when they’re inside the app, when they’re active on their phone, or at all times – even if the phone’s screen is off. This question brought up the complex idea of “status” in 
                the online world, which was a topic I chose not to deal with in the MVP, but would love to examine in a future iteration of the app.</p>
              <p class="regular-bold-title purple-text">3. What happens if there are three people on a call, and one leaves – does the call automatically drop because there are fewer than three people?</p>
              <p class="fr-case-study-text">I understood what this tester was asking and agreed with the confusion this might bring upon users in a group call. I began to think that it might be best to 
              continue promoting this feature as a group conference call but not plan to disable only two people from speaking if they are the only ones online. </p>
              <p class="regular-bold-title purple-text">Final Result</p>
             <p class="fr-case-study-text">For the MVP’s call feature, I ultimately decided to have green dots symbolize a user being “online,” referring to a user currently using the app, in which status 
              he or she  would receive a call. Red dots symbolize “offline” and indicate that the user is not currently using the app and would therefore not receive a call. I also decided that for the 
              sake of a simple and functional MVP, there would  be no “deselecting members” from the online list. The idea of curating the members of a call is an interesting feature and something that 
              would be worth looking into in the future, but I didn’t think it was a necessary addition to the current state of the app. </p>

            <p class="purple-text-title">Topic 2: Chat Aesthetic</p>
            <p class="fr-case-study-text">Even after adding color and branding to my mockups, I still felt they looked a little wireframe-y. I worked with a senior designer to revise the aesthetic of the 
              main chat view and give the app more of a high fidelity feel.  Here are two images of the before and after versions of a few screens:</p>

              <li><span-red>2)</span-red> I centered the card to eliminate excess grey space in the chat window and add an additional “social media” vibe. and a drop shadow replaces 
                the border. I also eliminated the chat card’s heavy border by giving the card a slight drop shadow instead.</li>
              <li><span-red>3)</span-red> I eliminated the “Love/Comment” bar’s heavy stroke and replaced it with a light blue background color.</li>
              <li><span-red>4)</span-red> I reduced the size of the love/comment button labels to further establish a visual hierarchy.</li>

           a hero section as well as various paragraphs about specific app features.</p>

<!--Conclusion-->
<section class="concl">
    <h5 class="black-text lessons">What I Learned</h5>
    <p class="fr-case-study-text purple-text-bold">1. Test often and at various stages of the design process:</p>
    <p class="fr-case-study-text">I started running user tests by creating clickable prototypes from  my low-fidelity wireframes, and found that the  questions and feedback that resulted  
      were instrumental to the project’s development. I tested and created various iterations of  my logo designs; each time getting closer to the final product.</p>
    <p class="fr-case-study-text purple-text-bold">2. Focus on creating a streamlined and uncluttered MVP, however cool those other features are:</p>
    <p class="fr-case-study-text">There were so many interesting and exciting features I initially wanted to include, but I eventually realized I needed to cut back on several potential features so that I could produce an MVP.</p>
    <p class="fr-case-study-text purple-text-bold">3. How to make a stronger UI:</p>
    <p class="fr-case-study-text">I learned to improve the app’s UI through color, space, line weight, and a distinct visual hierarchy.</p>
    <p class="fr-case-study-text purple-text-bold">4. How to effectively collaborate with senior designers:</p>
    <p class="fr-case-study-text">I worked on multiple iterations of my designs with two different senior designers. I learned how to take their suggestions into consideration and produce outcomes that reflected my preferences along with their recommendations.</p>

    <p id="final-para" class="fr-case-study-text">I had a great time creating this project, and it feels very rewarding to have turned a mere idea into a tangible prototype. I feel energized by the lessons the Family Room development process has taught me, and am excited to 
      bring my new-found knowledge and experience to future projects and opportunities.</p>

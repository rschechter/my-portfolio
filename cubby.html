            <h3 class="ps">Problem</h3>
            <p class="ps-text-body">The client expressed interest in the cloud storage app market,
            but did not have a clear vision of what they wanted their app to be or even who their target
            audience was. I needed to figure out a target audience based on gaps in the market and to
            create an application that had the correct combination of cloud storage features to satisfy
            this group. Some specific features that the client asked to be included were saving existing
            content, creating original content, organizing any content, uploading content, and collaboration.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
            <h3 class="ps">Solution</h3>
            <p class="ps-text-body">Through user research and a competitive analysis, I discovered that students
               are under-represented in the cloud storage market, so I was able to create Cubby and include the 
               specific features that the client asked for. Cubby offers students the ability to create and
              share original content, upload and share existing content, and browse for and save existing content
              from the internet. All of these features also allow students to collaborate with their peers and
              teachers by sharing the files, folders, or boards in their Cubby.</p>

             original content. I chose to take a closer look at these three apps by conducting a SWOT analysis, determining who their
             target audience is, what their positioning is, and what are some things that make them different from the competition.

           <h4>Preference Tests</h4>
           <p class="case-study-text">As my wireframes became more polished, I ran some preference tests to help me decide on some details in my design.
             Here are two of the images that I showed testers:</p>

           <img class="pref pref-buttons" src="images/pref-test-buttons.png">
           <p class="case-study-text pref-text">All three of my testers told me that they liked the turquoise icons better than the yellow  ones, because they
             were easier to see. I had thought this as well, but really wanted to figure out a way to include this yellow in my designs as I thought
             it was a nice accent color to the blues and turquoises, but I ultimately decided to let it go and just stick with the turquoise for
             readability purposes.</p>
           <img class="pref pref-cards" src="images/pref-cards.png">
           <p class="case-study-text pref-text">Two of my testers told me that they liked option 1 best, and one tester chose option 2. I decided to choose
             option 1 as I felt that the style aligned best with the overall brand. It evoked the greatest sense of simplicity which is something I
             was trying to achieve, and it gave the whole interface a modern and clean look.</p>

           <p id="prototypes-summary" class="case-study-text">After my mockups were completed, I used the prototyping tool on Figma to connect them to one another thereby
             enabling a user to test out the flow of the mockups. This phase was to help me as the designer understand the user’s ability to navigate
             the interface and therefore make tweaks to the designs if necessary.</p>

           <h4>User Testing Round 2</h4>
           <p class="case-study-text">I had someone who was acting as the “senior designer” critique Cubby at this stage, and I got a lot of important
             feedback that I am planning on incorporating into this project in a future iteration. Here are some changes/additions I have made based off
             of his feedback so far:</p>

        <h5 id="conclusion-label">Conclusion</h5>
        <p class="case-study-text-white concl-text">I learned a lot while working this project. I was really able to develop more of a hands-on understanding
             to the design process and it was interesting to see how one step leads to the next in a way that I feel truly makes sense. I
             found the multiple rounds of testing and iteration to be very productive and useful, and I am feeling much more comfortable
             with getting users’ feedback on different phases of the project. I am excited to incorporate these steps and all of the knowledge
             that I have gained into future projects.</p>
